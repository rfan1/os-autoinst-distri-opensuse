description: >
  Full Medium installation that covers the following cases:
     1. Additional modules enabled using SCC (Legacy, Development Tools,
        Web and Scripting, Containers, Desktop Applications);
     2. Yast patterns installed;
     3. System registration is skipped during installation;
     4. Installation is validated by successful boot and that YaST does not
        report any issues;
     5. Registration is performed on the installed system.
  On powerVM we don't want to test gnome, as is not used by customers, so setting
  system role to textmode, even though Desktop Applications module is enabled as
  is required for Development Tools module.
vars:
  DESKTOP: textmode
  SYSTEM_ROLE: textmode
